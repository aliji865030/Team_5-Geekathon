      <h2>How To Play / Rules</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>The game board is a grid of squares, some of which contain hidden mines.</li>
      <li>The player clicks on a square to reveal what's underneath.</li>
      <li>If the square contains a mine, the game is over and the player loses.</li>
      <li>If the square doesn't contain a mine, a number will be displayed indicating how many of its neighboring squares contain mines.</li>
      <li>The player can use this information to deduce which squares are safe to click on and which ones contain mines.</li>
      <li>The player can also mark squares that they think contain mines, to help keep track of which squares are dangerous.</li>
      <li>The game is won when all non-mine squares are uncovered.</li>
</ol>
