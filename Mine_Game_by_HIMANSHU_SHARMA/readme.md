

THIS PROJECT IS DONE BY USING MIXTURE OF COMPONENTS EXPRESSED BELOW.

1. **HTML Structure:**
Start by creating the basic structure of your Minesweeper grid using HTML. Each cell can be represented by a **`<div>`** element.
2. **CSS Styling:**
Use CSS to style your grid and make it visually appealing. You can add different colors for mines, numbers, and empty cells to make the game more user-friendly.
3. **JavaScript Logic:**
This is where the real magic happens. Write the JavaScript code to handle the game logic. You'll need functions to generate the Minesweeper grid, place mines randomly, calculate the number of mines around each cell, handle user clicks, and reveal cells.
4. **Game Logic:**
Implement the game rules, such as revealing adjacent cells when a zero is clicked, flagging cells, and handling game over conditions (like clicking on a mine).
5. **User Interactions:**
Use JavaScript to capture user clicks and update the game state accordingly. You'll need event5. listeners to handle left and right clicks on the cells.
